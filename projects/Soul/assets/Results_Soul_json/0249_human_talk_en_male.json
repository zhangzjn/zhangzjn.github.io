I’ve spent years seeking meaning in quiet moments — a book under a tree, a melody on the guitar, a conversation with a stranger. These small things anchor me. I believe in listening more than speaking, in patience over haste, and in kindness as a quiet revolution. We’re all navigating our own storms. Be gentle with yourself. And if you ever feel lost, remember: even the smallest light can guide you home.",
