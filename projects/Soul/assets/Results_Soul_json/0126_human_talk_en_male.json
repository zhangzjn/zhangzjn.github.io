It’s been with me through long road trips, quiet mornings, and moments of reflection. I love the way the sun hits the chrome, the sound of the engine, the feel of the steering wheel in my hands. It’s not just a hobby; it’s a connection to the past and a reminder to live with purpose. Life’s too short to drive in the fast lane without meaning. I’m just a man who appreciates the journey.",
