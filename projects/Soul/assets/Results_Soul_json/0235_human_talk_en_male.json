Every rip in my jeans, every gold chain, every bold graphic — it’s all part of my story. I’m not just skating; I’m building a legacy. The wall behind me? That’s my canvas. The world might see chaos, but I see freedom. I’m unapologetically me, and that’s my power.",

He wears a trendy jacket and ripped jeans, accessorized with a gold chain and a baseball cap, confidently looking directly into the camera as if narrating the story of street culture to the audience. The skateboard features a cartoon design, echoing the background graffiti, creating a striking visual harmony. The overall atmosphere is full of youthful energy and urban artistry.",
