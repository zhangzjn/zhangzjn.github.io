    "en_prompt": "The woman in the scene stands by an ancient stone bridge over a flowing stream, holding a folding fan adorned with floral and bird patterns, speaking gently toward the camera. She wears a red embroidered qipao, accessorized with exquisite jade ornaments and tassel earrings. Occasionally, she lightly turns the fan in her hand to complement her speech. The camera remains stationary, while the background features a stone bridge, flowing water, and lush green trees, creating a serene atmosphere of a classical Chinese garden. The subject harmoniously blends with her surroundings, showcasing the elegance of traditional Eastern beauty.",
