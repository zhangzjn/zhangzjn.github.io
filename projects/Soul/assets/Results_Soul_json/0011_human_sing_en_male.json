Every note carries a story, a memory, or a feeling too deep for words. I find peace in the simplicity of a single chord and power in the raw honesty of a song. This space, with its quiet walls and soft light, is where I become most myself. I hope my music touches someone, reminds them they’re not alone, and inspires them to create their own sound. Keep playing, keep singing, keep being brave.",
