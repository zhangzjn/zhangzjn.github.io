I enjoy walking through quiet campuses and city parks, always with a notebook in hand to capture thoughts and inspiration. I believe in the power of small moments—like sunlight through trees or a deep conversation with a friend. I’m curious about people, cultures, and stories, and I’m always open to learning something new. Life is a journey, and I’m grateful for every step.",
