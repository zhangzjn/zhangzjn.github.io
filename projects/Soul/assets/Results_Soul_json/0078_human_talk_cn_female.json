    "cn_prompt": "画面中的女士站在石桥上，身着淡青色刺绣旗袍，手持一把古典折扇，优雅地垂手于身前。她面带温婉微笑，正对着镜头讲话，偶尔轻抬扇子做些柔和的手势以匹配说话内容，镜头固定，背景是绿意盎然的中式园林，流水、垂柳与飞檐相映成趣，营造出宁静雅致的氛围。",
    "en_prompt": "The woman in the image stands on a stone bridge, wearing a light teal embroidered cheongsam, holding a classical folding fan gracefully in front of her. She wears a gentle, warm smile and speaks directly to the camera, occasionally lifting the fan slightly to make soft, expressive gestures that match her speech. The camera remains fixed. The background features a lush, traditional Chinese garden with flowing water, weeping willows, and upturned eaves, creating a serene and elegant atmosphere.",
