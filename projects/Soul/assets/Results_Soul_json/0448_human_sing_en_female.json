I walk through this modern world with a heart full of Victorian dreams and brass-powered imagination. I believe beauty lies in the intricate, the unusual, the bold. If you see me, you’re not just seeing a costume—you’re seeing a rebellion against the ordinary. Let your spirit be as daring as your dreams. The future is not just mechanical—it’s magical.",
