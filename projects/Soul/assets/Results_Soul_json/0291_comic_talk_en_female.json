I often sit under a sakura tree with my sketchbook, trying to capture the beauty of fleeting moments. Life is like these flowers—short but full of grace. I hope everyone can find peace in small things, like the warmth of sunlight or the sound of birds singing. Let’s cherish each day, even the quiet ones.",
