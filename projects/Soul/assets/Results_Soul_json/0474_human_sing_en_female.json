I love walking through cities, discovering hidden corners and fleeting emotions. I wear my jewelry not for fashion, but for meaning—each piece tells a story. I’m not loud, but I’m present. I believe in authenticity, in being true to myself, even when the world tries to mold me. Life is a photo waiting to be taken—frame by frame, moment by moment.",
