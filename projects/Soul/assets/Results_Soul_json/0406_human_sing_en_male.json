The leather cuff on my wrist, the chain around my neck—they’re not just accessories. They’re stories, memories, and quiet reminders of where I’ve been. I believe in authenticity, in standing tall with arms crossed not in defiance, but in quiet strength. Let your style speak for you, and let your soul lead the way.",
