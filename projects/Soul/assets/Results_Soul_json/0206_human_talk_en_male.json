Each page turned is a journey through time, and each pocket watch I collect reminds me of the precious moments we must cherish. Knowledge is not just power—it’s connection. It connects us to the past, to each other, and to the future we are writing. Let us never stop seeking wisdom, for it is the light that guides us through uncertainty.",
