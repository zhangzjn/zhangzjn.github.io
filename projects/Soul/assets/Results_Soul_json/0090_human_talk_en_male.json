I find peace in the stillness between thoughts, in the way light hits a city street at dusk, or the silence after a long hike. I don’t rush to speak; I listen first. I read to understand, not to impress. I value depth over speed, connection over distraction. Life is not about how fast we move, but how deeply we feel. That’s what I’m searching for—authentic moments, real conversations, and the courage to be still.",
