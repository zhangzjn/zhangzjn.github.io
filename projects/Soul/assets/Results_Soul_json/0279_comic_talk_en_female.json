Though I’m from the 17th century, I believe beauty and curiosity connect all times. I enjoy painting quiet moments and reading stories that spark imagination. I’m gentle and thoughtful, always looking for meaning in small details. I hope you find joy in the simple things too—like a soft light, a pearl’s glow, or a smile. Let’s share stories and dreams.",
