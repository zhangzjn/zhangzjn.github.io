I wear my safety gear not just for rules, but because I care about my team and the quality of our work. These blueprints aren’t just lines on paper—they’re promises to families who will one day call this place home. I’ve seen the sweat, the storms, and the triumphs. And I’ll keep showing up, because what we build matters. Safety first, integrity always.",

He speaks directly to the camera with a focused expression, occasionally pointing to specific details on the blueprint with his finger to accompany his explanation.",
