My camera is my journal, capturing stories the city forgets. I believe in small acts of kindness, long walks without a destination, and conversations that go deeper than surface-level. Life isn’t about being seen; it’s about seeing — truly seeing — the world around you. Stay curious. Stay quiet. And don’t be afraid to be yourself, even when no one’s watching.",
