Every city has a soul, and I’m drawn to its quiet corners—the places where stories unfold without fanfare. I value honesty, depth, and connection. I don’t chase fame, but I do chase meaning. If you’re looking for answers, start by asking the right questions. And remember: even in the busiest places, there’s space for stillness. Be present. Be kind. Be curious.",
