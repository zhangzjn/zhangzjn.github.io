    "message": "I find beauty in the quiet moments—like standing in a forest, surrounded by trees that whisper stories. Fashion is my language, a way to express who I am without words. The coat, the tie, the pearls—they’re not just clothes; they’re pieces of my identity. I don’t follow trends; I create my own. Life is about finding your rhythm, your color, your truth. Don’t be afraid to stand out. Be bold. Be you. And always, always listen to the trees—they know more than we think.",

    "en_prompt": "The boy in the image is leaning against a tree trunk, speaking directly to the camera, with a fixed shot.

The background features a natural woodland setting with dappled sunlight filtering through the trees, creating a calm yet slightly dramatic atmosphere.",
