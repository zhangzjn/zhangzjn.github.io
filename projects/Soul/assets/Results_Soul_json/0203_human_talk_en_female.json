I love the sun on my skin, the salt in my hair, and the freedom of chasing the next perfect swell. Life’s too short to wear boring clothes or stay in one place. I surf, I travel, I create. I’m not just living—I’m experiencing. If you’re looking for adventure, come find me where the sea meets the sky. Let’s make memories that last a lifetime.",
