Life moves fast, but I try to pause and truly see the world — in the details of a leaf, the expression in someone’s eyes, or the silence between words. I’m not always loud, but I’m deeply present. I find peace in nature, in music, and in the pages of a well-worn book. I’m learning to trust my own thoughts, to ask questions without needing immediate answers. I hope to live with intention, kindness, and a little bit of wonder every day.",
