    "en_prompt": "The woman in the image stands in a traditional Chinese courtyard, wearing a red qipao and holding a folding fan adorned with floral patterns. She speaks gracefully to the camera, occasionally gently tapping or adjusting her posture with the fan to match her speech. The camera remains fixed. The background features classic ancient architecture and blooming pink flowering trees, with sunlight filtering through the leaves and casting dappled light on the stone pathway, creating a serene and elegant atmosphere. She wears green earrings and a jade bracelet, her expression calm, gentle, and composed.",
