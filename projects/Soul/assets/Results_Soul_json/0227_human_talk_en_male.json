I value authenticity, and I’m always chasing the next horizon. Life’s too short to follow the crowd. I wear my leather jacket not just for style, but as a symbol of who I am: tough, resilient, and unafraid to face the night. I’m not looking for approval—I’m building my own story, one ride at a time.",
