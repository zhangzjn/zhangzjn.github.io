My style is a blend of rebellion and elegance, a reflection of who I am: someone who embraces individuality. I don’t follow trends; I create my own. I love capturing moments through my lens, especially those that tell stories of solitude and strength. Life is too short to blend in. Stay true, stay bold, and never be afraid to stand out.",
