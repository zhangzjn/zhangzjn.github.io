I take pride in building and fixing things with my own hands. It’s not just a job; it’s a way of life. I value precision, safety, and hard work. If you need something done right, you come to me. That’s the kind of trust I earn — one project at a time. And yes, I wear those goggles not just for safety — they’re part of my identity. I’m proud to be a mechanic, and I’ll always stand by my work.",
