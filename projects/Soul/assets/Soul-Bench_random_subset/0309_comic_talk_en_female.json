I love lounging in the warm sunlight, watching birds from the window, and occasionally playing with my favorite feather toy. I may look serious, but I’m just deep in thought—probably about the best nap spot or the meaning of life. I’m gentle, affectionate, and enjoy quiet moments with my human. If you’re looking for a calm, cuddly companion, I’m your cat. Let’s share some quiet time together, maybe with a little purring and a lot of love.",
