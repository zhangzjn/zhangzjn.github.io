The mountains don’t care about your past—they only care about your next step. I hike not to escape life, but to find myself in the silence between peaks. Each summit is a reminder: progress isn’t always measured in miles, but in the courage to keep going. To anyone chasing their own summit—breathe deep, move forward, and let the wild shape your soul.",
